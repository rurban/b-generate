Revision history for the Perl extension B::Generate.

1.53 - 2015-05-04 (Reini Urban)
   - Fixes for perl>5.18 without exported pad_alloc (HAVE_PAD_ALLOC)
     i.e. MSWin32 or AIX. [CPAN #104208]

1.52 - 2015-05-02 (Reini Urban)
   - Fix 1.51 regression for older perls <5.18

1.51 - 2015-05-02 (Reini Urban)
   - Fixes for 5.21.22: op->sibling, added op->sibparent for -DPERL_OP_PARENT.
   - Weaker op_list test, to match the number of ops. Also add op_signature variant.
   - Adjust README

1.50 - 2014-12-24 (Reini Urban)
   - Fixed for 5.21.7 multideref by Father Chrysostomos [cpan#101070]

1.49 - Fri Aug 8 2014 (Reini Urban)
   - Fix t/new_cv.t with Devel::Cover
   - Add test_cover target
   - tested up to 5.21.2 -DPERL_OP_PARENT
   - add dates to the latest Changelog entries

1.48 - Mon Sep 30 2013 (Reini Urban)
   - Support the 5.20 changes so far (BIND vs INVLIST)
   - Simplify tautological (sv)->sv_flags != SVTYPEMASK to !SvIS_FREED(sv)

1.47 - Thu Oct 11 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - Support the 5.17.4 boolkeys removal. (andk)

1.46 - Sat Aug 25 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - Support the 5.17.4 AV -> PADLIST change. (sprout)

1.45 - Thu Jul 19 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - Remove fold_constants in $op->convert.
     Inproper usage can lead to leaks, which p5p hates. 
     constants have to be folded beforehand, just manually.
   - skip t/cpan70398.t as B::Concise prints foul on 5.6.

1.44 - Wed Mar 7 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - Generate.xs: global-buffer-overflow detected by AddressSanitizer:
     specialsv_list[7] for 0-6

1.43 - Wed Feb 22 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - t/cpan70398.t: Windows quote fix

1.42 - Sat Feb 11 2012 (Reini Urban)
   - Generate.xs: disable B::COP->warnings [CPAN #70396] detected by Zefram
   - t/cpan70396.t: new
   - Makefile.PL: make release: add git push

1.41 - (Reini Urban)
   - Generate.xs: fixed B::SVOP->sv [CPAN #70398] detected by Zefram
   - t/cpan70398.t: new
   - Generate.pm: do not import B
   - Makefile.PL: add target release, make it easier to copy depends
   - t/basic.t: fixed debug_const()

1.40 - (Reini Urban)
   - Makefile.PL: darwin fixed by Chia-liang Kao. Tested ok on all
     darwin perls but 5.6.2.

1.39 - (Reini Urban)
   - removed B 1.09 dependency. Tested down to B 1.02 perl-5.8.4 but it was 
     claimed to work down to perl-5.5.62

1.38 - (Reini Urban)
   - Generate.xs, t/find_cv.t: minor optimizations
   - t/new_cv.t: skip with B < 1.09 [cpan#70397]

1.37 - (Reini Urban)
   - SVOP->sv: added 2nd optional arg cvref for threaded perls, the 
     surrounding cv of the op
   - make PADOP->sv writable
   - t/const.t: test SVOP->new "const" (from Devel::BeginLift)
   - t/basic.t: fixed ithreads tests 3,5,6.
     const is an SVOP but it should be a PADOP really.
   - improved SVOP->sv() read-only case: no GEN_PAD needed.
   - XS internal: harmonize croak usage
   -   renamed OP_CUSTOM_OPS to CHECK_CUSTOM_OPS
   - updated cc_opclass from 5.15

1.36 - (Reini Urban)
   - t/op_list.t: added two more ops for 5.15

1.35 - (Reini Urban)
   - fixed t/new_cv.t
   - improved Makefile.PL

1.34 - (Reini Urban)
   - enabled old basic find_cv test (seq workaround)
   - added scope.t test

1.33 - (Reini Urban)
   - added t/find_cv.t
   - improved overall test coverage from 30% to 40%
   - precise limitation warning

1.3202 - (Reini Urban)
   - Fix a few assertion errors PL_curcop == &PL_compiling
   - Reformat some XS funcs 
   - Remove yet unneeded BTest.pm tests

1.3201 - (Reini Urban)
   - Actually use the new unsupported function checks from git.
   - use Perl_cv_clone as this symbol is tested. Do not rely on
     a public cv_clone macro.

1.32 - (Reini Urban)
   - Check each unsupported function better and extra
   - B::CV->NEW_with_start disabled with strict linkers 
     fixes Can't locate object method "NEW_with_start"
   - Do not hardcode exported B OPf_ flags, so we don't really need 
     to test for sameness.
     We keep the tests for reference.

1.31 - (Reini Urban)
   - add prof and cov targets for gcc
   - comment test coverage in the code
   - check for each exported symbol on non-broken platforms

1.3001 - (Reini Urban)
   - fix MANIFEST

1.30 - (Reini Urban)
  - switch from Module::Build to ExtUtils::MakeMaker. Module::Build 
    cannot properly track dependencies and drives me insane.
    mv lib/B/Generate.xs .
    mv BTest.pm t/
  - add prominent warning about PERL_DL_NONLAZY. This is a 
    run-time problem. p5p effectively dropped B::Generate support 
    since 5.10.

1.29 - (Reini Urban)
  - remove CALL_FPTR, removed from core with 5.13.4 commit 16c91539

1.28 - (Reini Urban)
  - fix CPAN #59502 "Provokes error for B::Concise, B::Debug and B::Deparse"
    (svclassnames patch by Ben Morrow)
  - added t/svclasses.t for CPAN #59502
  - silence COP_warnings and OP_desc warnings
  - fix OP_targ compilation for MSWin32. Missing sv decl
  - added README
  - added github repo url

1.27 - (Reini Urban)
  - fixed op->targ: implemented pad_alloc for DISABLE_PERL_CORE_EXPORTED 
    platforms (Win32, AIX, newer cygwin) with strict linkers.
    CPAN #28912 hereby partially solved.
    posix with export PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 still broken.

1.26 - (Reini Urban)
  - fix t/op_list.t for 5.12

1.25 - (Reini Urban)
  - removed Devel::Peek from BTest.pm

1.24 - (Reini Urban)
  - 5.11.2 does not understand 5.5.62
    Prereq '5.5.62' for 'perl' is not supported by Module::Build::Compat
    ERROR: perl (5.006002) is installed, but we need version >= 5.5062

1.23 - (Reini Urban)
  - fix Bug #52490 for 5.6.2. const char* not in typemap.

1.22 - (Reini Urban)
  - update t/op_list.t for 5.11.1 and 5.11.2
  - disable fold_constants for cygwin gcc-4 also

1.21 - (Reini Urban)
  - fix t/basic.t for >=5.10.1 and blead. skip panic restartop

1.20 - (Reini Urban)
  - Remove certain features for MSWin32: disable CV->NEW_with_start,
    setting op->targ, and folding constants with op->convert.
    Reason: Perl_pad_alloc, Perl_fold_constants, Perl_cv_clone
    not exported with MSVC and mingw perls. CPAN #28912
  - fixed __svop_new for MSVC. cl is stricter
  - fixed t/inspect-this.t for MSWin32: file regex => eq test
  - t/inspect-this.t requires B::Concise 0.64
  - fix t/op_list.t for perl-5.6.2

1.19 - (Reini Urban)
  - Re-enable fold_constants in $op->convert, disabled with 1.16

1.18 - (Reini Urban)
  - Remove the t/new_cv.t todos. 
  - Explain the correct B::CV::NEW_with_start behaviour

1.17 - (Reini Urban)
  - fixed B::CV::NEW_with_start padlist for 5.10 and newer (different cv_clone behaviour),
    only need to fixup padlist targ for cv_clone

1.16 - (Reini Urban)
  - remove fold_constants from OP_convert() as it is not exported from blead anymore. 
    No functional difference.
  - skip t/inspect_this.t plan on unknown patchlevels 

1.15 - (Reini Urban)
  - disable some new_cv TARG test failures in t/new_cv.t for 5.10 and higher,
    new_cv dumps core at destroy with 5.8.6 and lower
  - disable a segv test for 5.11 in t/basic.t
  - added to http://github.com/rurban/b-generate,
    another older svn repo is at http://svn.jifty.org/svn/jifty.org/B-Generate/

1.14 - (Reini Urban)
  - fix t/inspect-this.t for 5.8.9

1.13 - (released by Reini Urban)
  - same as 1.12_10

1.12

  _0501
      - reduced dependency on B => 1.09
      - added broken/failing t/synopsis.t - very raw, moving ahead
      - started build.nt - attempt to loop over opnames and construct ops
  _0502
      - added BTest.pm and several files using it
  _06 - "duh, thanks CPANTS" release
      - undo creeping 'feature'isms in tests (5.8 friendly)
      - static renderings dont port, drop test_all_ops in inspect-btest 
      - drop filegv from nextstate tests (caused uninit-strings in prints)
  _07 Anton Berezin
      - fixed a leak in find_cv_by_root()
  _08 Reini Urban
      - cop_label now in hints_hash (5.11 Change #33656)

      - fix t/inspect-btest.t test count
      - fix t/inspect-this.t not ok 568 - ->LEN 0.
	skip all PV->LEN tests >= 5.10
      - removed //= from BTest to support 5.8 and older
  _09 Reini Urban
      - fix 5.8.8 test PVIV->NV
      - < 5.8 and blead DEBUGGING builds fail, the rest passes

        where B::SVOP is normally used
      - added missing t/op_list.t OP_LIST indices for 5.8 (Reini Urban)

1.11 - (releaed by Josh Ben Jore)
  - rt#29257 - patches from Reini Urban & Jim Cromie

1.10 - (Josh Ben Jore)
  - License clarification. B::Generate is available under the same
    terms as perl. Dist now includes copy of Artistic and GPL licenses.

1.09 - (Josh Ben Jore)
  - Merged distributions:
    - S/SW/SWALTERS/B-Generate-1.06_1.tar.gz
      - Removed ppaddr setting for OP_LIST
      - Call Perl_fold_constants instead of fold_constants
    - M/MS/MSCHWERN/B-Generate-1.06_2.tar.gz
      - Awesome!
      - fold_constants is called w/ thread context
    - J/JJ/JJORE/B-Generate-1.07.tar.gz
      - Populates specialsv_list
    - J/JJ/JJORE/B-Generate-1.08.tar.gz
      - Nothing interesting, apparently.
    - RT #4747:
      - changes to compile for 5.8.1+ by Jim Cromie <jcromie@cpan.org>
        - altered Build.PL to add extra_compiler_flags when building for 5.8.x,
          ie: -DPERL_CUSTOM_OPS -DPERL_CUSTOM_OPCODES
          these didnt work for me under 5.6.x
        - silenced redefined warnings with $SIG{__WARN__}
        - various XS tweaks: casts, aTHX_, and Perl_ prefix on symbols
        - various pm tweaks to silence warnings


1.08 Thu Nov 25 23:00:00 CST 2004 jbenjore
    - Remembered to change Simon's address to mine

1.07 Thu Nov 25 22:49:00 CST 2004 jbenjore
    - Added some missing contants to Generate.xs

1.06 Sun Jul 28 18:43:06 CEST 2002 abergman
    - Added support for changing PV in SvPV

1.06 Tue Jul  2 14:37:43 CEST 2002 abergman
    - If PL_compcv is set, we will return that cv instead
      of trying to find the root. PL_compcv is only set
      during compilation when we only can safely work with ops
      during that compilation, and the next approach won't work
      since optree isn't complete.

1.05 Thu Jun 27 23:57:02 CEST 2002 abergman
    - Apperently we the previous release was a bit too quick.
      Sometimes the CV for the PL_eval_root doesn't have a real
      CvROOT set so we create a new fake temporary CV.

1.04 Thu Jun 27 22:41:07 CEST 2002 abergman
    - Made find_cv support working in an existing eval ""

1.03  June 26, 2002 abergman

1.01  May 02, 2002 Simon Cozens
    - Added op_mutate. Fixed op_convert targ

1.00  Wed Aug 29 00:24:30 BST 2001 Simon Cozens
    - It's time for a 1.0 release, this has been tested thoroughly
      enough.
    - Support for custom ops. Oh yes.

0.07  Mon Jun  4 11:10:02 BST 2001
    - Oh, all sorts. Mainly undocumented. Added documentation about the
      undocumentation.
    - append_elem has been fixed up, and prepend_elem has been added.
    - convert and scope
    - assignment
    - constructor for conditional (if/then/else) ops. (B::LOGOP->newcond)
    - constructor for subroutines. (B::CV->newsub_simple)
    - lots of field testing with the bytecode compiler. (Shiny-Byte)

0.06  Mon May 28 18:08:12 BST 2001
    - Backed out disastrous context compilation fix
    - Fixed B::LOGOP->new and B::LISTOP->new - it was creating binops and 
      blessing them as B::BINOP. Oops!
    - Added the undocumented "append_elem" method; this is enough for
      you to create subroutine calls if you know how. I should probably
      make a "gimme a sub call" utility function.

0.05  Wed Apr 18 08:50:33 2001
    - The bastards took op_children away!
    - Fixed interpret context compilation bug

0.04  Wed Mar 21 00:18:27 2001
    - Urgh. Fixed *nasty* segfault bug. (PL_op==0x0 after ->new)
    - Added "linklist" and undocumented "clean" method
    - Added "newstate" method
    - Documentation nits

0.03  Wed Jan 10 00:21:08 2001
    - Test script needed a fix to stop ->targ pointing into never-never
      land. Not *exactly* sure why.

0.02  Fri Jan  5 13:14:29 2001
    - Added a couple more methods and tests, mainly SVOP and SV methods.

0.01  Sat Dec 23 18:00:08 2000
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.20 with options
		-A -n B::Generate
