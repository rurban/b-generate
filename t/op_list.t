# B::Generate.pm comments used to say "MUST FIX CONSTANTS",

# What's more, OP_LIST value has changed over releases.
# This is not required anymore. We keep this test just for reference.

# 1st test is baseline, not even using/testing B::Generate.  This
# insures that we get failure reports until we get right
# release-dependent values, which we reverify using B-Gen in 2nd test
